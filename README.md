# Privacy Camera by katahiromz

## What is this?

This app lets you take photos or record video by overlaying eye censored lines, blurring, or blacking out the image in real time.

Facial recognition helps protect your privacy.

## How to Use

* When you first launch the app, it will request camera and microphone permissions. Please allow them.
* The camera will automatically launch and any faces it recognizes will be overlaid with eye censored lines, blurring, or blacking out.
* The three buttons at the bottom have the following meanings:
- Camera Switch Button: Switches between the front and rear cameras.
- Photo Button: Takes a photo.
- Record Button: Starts or stops recording.
* The gear in the upper left is the settings button. You can configure the app.

## Disclaimer

- Facial recognition technology is currently not established, so it is fundamentally impossible to consistently recognize faces correctly.
- Face recognition may fail in extremely bright, dark, or sunny locations.
- Faces facing away from the camera, tilted faces, or faces lying sideways may not be recognized.
- Faces that are partially or completely outside the screen or that are too small may not be recognized.
- Faces with paint on their faces, faces wearing masks, faces from manga or anime, or animal faces may not be recognized.
- Faces that move violently or suddenly appear may not be recognized.
- If face recognition is not possible, the face may remain displayed as is.
- In principle, it is not possible to completely hide a face. If you want to completely hide a face, please review and edit the footage after recording.
