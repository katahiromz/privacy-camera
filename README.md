# Privacy Camera by katahiromz

## What is this?

This app allows you to take photos or record video while overlaying a black eye line on the camera image.

Facial recognition helps protect your privacy.

## How to Use

* When you launch the app, it will request camera and microphone permissions. Please allow these permissions.
* The camera will automatically launch and a black eye line will be drawn on your face.
* The three buttons at the bottom have the following meanings:
    - Camera Switch Button: Switches between the front and rear cameras.
    - Photo Button: Takes a photo.
    - Record Button: Starts or stops recording.
* The gear in the upper left is the Settings button. You can configure the app.

## Disclaimer

- Currently, facial recognition is not a well-established technology, so it is fundamentally impossible to always correctly recognize faces.
- Face recognition may fail in extremely bright, extremely dark, or sunny locations.
- Faces not facing the camera, tilted faces, or faces lying sideways may not be recognized.
- Faces that are partially or completely off-screen may not be recognized.
- Faces with paint on them, faces wearing masks, faces from manga or anime, or animal faces may not be recognized.
- Faces that move rapidly or suddenly appear may not be recognized.
- If face recognition is not possible, the face may be displayed as is.
- In principle, it is not possible to completely hide a face, so if you want to completely hide a face, please check and edit the image after capturing it.
